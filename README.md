# Introduction
For our group, we decided to work with the pet licensing data, to inform Seattleites on pet ownership trends and encourage the people of Seattle to adopt unlicensed pets at the animal shelters. Our goal is to acknowledge people who have gotten their pets licensed in the City of Seattle and raise awareness of adopting pets, such as cats and dogs.
We gathered all of our information from this website. [Seattle Pet Licenses](https://www.kaggle.com/aaronschlegel/seattle-pet-licenses)

# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
One of the main take away from the three graphs is seeing how the number of people licensing their pets has drastically increased throughout the years. This indicates that as the years goes on, the amount of pets getting licensed has gone up. Which is a great thing because it is beneficial for the owners and the pets themselves. Another takeaway is  seeing the difference between how many cats get licensed and how many dogs get licensed. When seeing this, we can assume that there are not as many cat owners as there are dog owners, or that there are less people who get their pets licensed if their pet is a cat. The final takeaway is seeing which year the number licensed pets increased the most for both pets and the visualization of how there is a huge gap between licensed cats and dogs during each year.
