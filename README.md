# Introduction
For our group, we decided to work with the pet licensing data, to inform Seattleites on pet ownership trends and encourage the people of Seattle to adopt unlicensed pets at the animal shelters. Our goal is to acknowledge people who have gotten their pets licensed in the City of Seattle and raise awareness of adopting pets, such as cats and dogs.
We gathered all of our information from this website. [Seattle Pet Licenses](https://www.kaggle.com/aaronschlegel/seattle-pet-licenses)

# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
The main three takeaways from the graphs in this project, seeing how the number of people licensing their pets has drastically increased throughout the years. The difference between how many cats get licensed and how many dogs get licensed. The final takeaway is seeing which year the number licensed pets increased the most for both pets and the visualization of how there is a huge gap between licensed cats and dogs during each year.
